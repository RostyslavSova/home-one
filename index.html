                <p>Model S is designed from the ground up to be the safest, most exhilarating sedan

                    2.7 seconds. Model S comes with Autopilot capabilities designed to make your 
                    highway driving not only safer, but stress free.</p>

                <header><h3>Tesla Model X</h3></header>
                <p>Model X is the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history.
                    With all-wheel drive and a 100 kWh battery providing 475 kilometers of range, Model X
                    has ample seating for seven adults and all of their gear. And it’s ludicrously fast,
                    accelerating from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in as quick as 3.1 seconds. 
                    Model X is the SUV uncompromised.</p>

                <header><h3>Tesla Model 3</h3></header>
                <p>Designed to attain the highest safety ratings in every category, Model 3 
                    achieves 220 miles of range while starting at only 35,000 USD before incentives.
                    Model 3 is a smaller, simpler, more affordable electric car then Model S. 
                    Although it is our newest vehicle, Model 3 is not “Version 3” or the most 
                    advanced Tesla. Like Model S, it is designed to be the safest car in its class.</p>
